/*xlib_chaste_bitmap_font.h*/

/*
this file tries to make a basic font library similar to my SDL version except that it uses entirely my own functions in "xlib_chaste_bitmap.h" to load a Windows BMP file into my own "chaste_bitmap" structure defined in the other file. This takes the place of an SDL surface but always assumes that the surface is loaded as a 32 bit unsigned integer.
